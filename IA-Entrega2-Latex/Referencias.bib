abstract = {Abstract Orienteering is a sport in which start and end points are specified along with other locations. These other locations have associated scores. Competitors seek to visit, in a fixed amount of time, a subset of these locations on the way from the start point to the end point in order to maximize the total score. An effective center-of-gravity heuristic is presented that outperforms heuristics from the literature.}

abstract="The tourist trip design problem (TTDP) refers to a route-planning problem for tourists interested in visiting multiple points of interest (POIs). TTDP solvers derive daily tourist tours, i.e., ordered visits to POIs, which respect tourist constraints and POIs attributes. The main objective of the problem discussed is to select POIs that match tourist preferences, thereby maximizing tourist satisfaction, while taking into account a multitude of parameters and constraints (e.g., distances among POIs, visiting time required for each POI, POIs visiting days/hours, entrance fees, weather conditions) and respecting the time available for sightseeing on a daily basis. The aim of this work is to survey models, algorithmic approaches and methodologies concerning tourist trip design problems. Recent approaches are examined, focusing on problem models that best capture a multitude of realistic POIs attributes and user constraints; further, several interesting TTDP variants are investigated. Open issues and promising prospects in tourist trip planning research are also discussed.",

abstract="A general description of the sport of orienteering in its two forms known as orienteering event and score orienteering event is given. The similarities between the latter and the generalized travelling salesman problem are underlined, and a common mathematical model is deduced. A `good', if not `optimal' solution of the corresponding problem by means of an efficient and computationally feasible method is derived and discussed. This solution is obtained by the use of either of two algorithms based on approximate methods. The two algorithms are given, and their efficiency is tested on a number of illustrative problems. Finally, a comparison between the two forms of the sport of orienteering is made.",

abstract="The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is the generalization to the case of multiple tours of the Orienteering Problem, known also as Selective Traveling Salesman Problem. A set of potential customers is available and a profit is collected from the visit to each customer. A fleet of vehicles is available to visit the customers, within a given time limit. The profit of a customer can be collected by one vehicle at most. The objective is to identify the customers which maximize the total collected profit while satisfying the given time limit for each vehicle. We propose two variants of a generalized tabu search algorithm and a variable neighborhood search algorithm for the solution of the TOP and show that each of these algorithms beats the already known heuristics. Computational experiments are made on standard instances.",

abstract="The forward checking routine (FC) of Haralick and Elliott attempts to encourage early failures within the search tree of constraint satisfaction problems, leading to a reduction in nodes visited, which tends to result in reduced search effort. In contrast, Gaschnig's backmarking routine (BM) attempts to avoid performing redundant consistency checks. These two algorithms are combined to give FC-BM, an algorithm that attempts to minimise the number of nodes visited, while avoiding redundant consistency checks. This algorithm is further enhanced such that it incorporates conflict-directed backjumping (CBJ) to give FC-BM-CBJ. A series of experiments are then carried out on really hard problems in an attempt to position these new algorithms with respect to the known algorithms.",
